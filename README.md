# How to Use Projects to get the Most of Your Undergraduate Experience in Engineering

Note: I am a mechanical engineering student at Cornell University. I am currently finishing up my undergraduate degree, while simultaneously starting my Master's of Engineering Degree. This is a general guideline of how to choose projects as an undergrad to best prepare yourself for future careers. There are many opportunities available to students of any university. 

# Timing of Projects. 

One important consideration to make is that there is a lot of time in school to do many projects. Typically, with 4 years of undergraduate education, with more opportunities for education and project exploration in graduate education. 

Spending more than 1-2 years on a single project allows for leadership opportunities. 

Spending 3-4 years on a single project will almost guarantee high leadership position as well as much expertise. 

Because of this, it is important to get involved in projects as early as possible in one's education. 

# Diversity of Projects. 

There is much benefit to getting very involved in a single project, carrying it out from begining to end, carrying it through multiple cycles, truly understanding its function, and even exploring many different components of a single large project. 

However, at the same time, as with anything, as time goes on, we see the effect of diminishing marginal returns. At first, any time spent on the project is extremely educational. As time goes on and we gain base education, time spent might even be more valuable. However, after a couple of years, if one is not continuously growing, changing, and being challenged, the benefits start to drop off. 

If one stays on the same project, they should move within it to learn more. Ideally, however, it is most probably to learn ore if one changes to a new project after a couple of years. 

An example comes from my experience. As a mechanical engineer, there are many options for both career options and project opportunities. One can be involved in concept design, structural analysis, computer modeling, testing, and design iteration. It is important to change projects when one has not had exposure to more than one large area of opportunity. 

# Involvement with the Longevity of the Project.

One benefit of being part of a single project for a long time, is the opportunity to truly grow on it, to watch others grow on it, and to become part of the cycle of members coming and going.

You have the time to truly make an impact on the project and affect how the future of it goes. 

# Learning to Adapt.

Challenging oneself with a new project is a great way to learn to adapt. In the real workforce, one does not stay on a single team or a single project. Thus, it is great practice and experience to have to learn quickly, learn from others, and share new ideas even when on something new.
